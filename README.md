## Why Codedrops?

CodeDrops Snippet Saver was conceived with a simple yet powerful purpose: to revolutionize how coders manage their snippets.

Unlike generic solutions, we recognized a need for a specialized tool that caters to the specific demands of developers.

## Get Started

To run SWE Projects locally, just run the following commands in both directory (backend and frontend) to install the dependencies and run the app locally.

```
npm install

npm run dev
```

### Connect your own database
Codedrops uses MongoDB for database. To connect your own local instance to Codedrops, create a MongoDB
account and create a database. Once you create a database, you can connect it to Codedrops by creating a `.env` file
at the root directory and add an environment variable called `MONGODB_URI` pointing to your MongoDB db url.
